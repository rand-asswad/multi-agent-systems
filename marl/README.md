# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

In the context of MAS course, I studied the paper
[Markov games as a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring07/cps296.3/littman94markov.pdf)
by Littman, Michael L. ICML, 1994
that introduced an RL algorithm for a two-player zero-sum game.

I expanded on MARL through the learning theory course material
[From single-agent to multi-agent reinforcement learning: Foundational concepts and methods](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~mtjspaan/readingGroup/learningNeto05.pdf)
by Neto G. 2005 which allowed to study the state of the art of MARL in different situations
and to dig deeper into optimality concepts in the context of game theory.

I finally compared with the more recent paper
[Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05438.pdf)
by Yaodong Yang et al. ICML 2018
which introduced a new approach of RL using Mean Field Theory that addresses
the curse of dimensionality in large MARL systems in different
situations of games (general-sum games, zero-sum games, and team games).
