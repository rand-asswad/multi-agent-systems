# Multi-Agent Systems

Studied Multi-Agent Systems as part of my Masters program with focus on
the **belief-desire-intention** model.

I worked on three projects in the context of MAS (hosted in this repository):

- **Capture The Flag:** a simple game implemented using [jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/)
  as a basic BDI-model application.
- **Luneray Flu:** a simulation of the propagation of the flu in the city of Luneray (Normandy, France)
  using [GAMA](https://gama-platform.github.io/) modeling environment.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):** studied MARL in the framework of Game Theory.
  I wrote a review paper (in french) to analyse a scientific paper and compare it with more recent litterature.

Each project is explained in detail in its `readme` file.
